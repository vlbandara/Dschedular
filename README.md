## Project Overview

This research project aims to conduct a comparative analysis of various task scheduling algorithms in cloud computing environments. We utilize CloudSim 4.0 to simulate and evaluate the performance of different scheduling algorithms.

### Algorithms Under Study
1. DLA (Deep Learning Algorithm)
2. GA (Genetic Algorithm)
3. PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)
4. ACO (Ant Colony Optimization)

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code for algorithm implementations and CloudSim simulations
  - `PSO/` - Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization
  - `GA/` - Implementation of Genetic Algorithm
  - `DLA/` - Implementation of Deep Learning Algorithm
  - `ACO/` - Implementation of Ant Colony Optimization
- `results/` - Simulation results and performance metrics
- `docs/` - Project documentation and research papers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- CloudSim 4.0 library
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dschedular.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure CloudSim 4.0 is properly added to the project's classpath.

### Running Simulations
1. Navigate to the desired algorithm's main class (e.g., `PSOCloudSimExample.java`).
2. Run the main method to start the simulation.
3. Results will be displayed in the console and saved in the `results/` directory.
